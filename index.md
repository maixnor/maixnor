# Welcome to the maixnor realm

### Introduction

I am a programmer, I make computers go `beep boop`.

### Technologies :robot:

I can speak:
* Java 8,11,17
* Python 3
* Kotlin
* HTML/CSS/JS

But I really :heart: `dotnet` and `C#`.

* Framework 4
* .net 5 & 6
* C# 4 - 10

### Sport

After 13 years of practicing Judo I have achieved the first Dan.

Apart from being on the mat and throwing people around I like 
to be in the (also frozen) water either with a wake- or snowboard.
