# Welcome to the Maixnor realm

I am a programmer, I make computers go `beep boop`.

Check out my [Terminal](https://gray-moss-0be855b03.azurestaticapps.net).

### Technologies :robot:

I can speak:
* Java 8,11,17
* Java Spring Boot
* Python 3
* HTML 5 / CSS 3 / JS

But I really :heart: `dotnet` and `C#`.

* .net 5 & 6
* ASP.net 5 & 6
* Blazor (WASM)
* C# 4 - 10

### Linux

I run [Garuda Linux](https://garudalinux.org) which is an arch 
based distro as my daily driver. The performance and 
desktop experience is just great on the KDE Dr460nized 
edition. Combine this with the amazing KDE tools
and you get amazing results. I love it.

Also I have experience that the 
development experience with dotnet and java 
is far superior to Windows.

### Sport

After 13 years of practicing Judo I have achieved the first Dan.
You may refer to me as Sensei.

Apart from being on the mat throwing (and be thrown by) people around 
I like to be in the - also frozen - water either with a wake- or snowboard.
